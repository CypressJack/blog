# My Technology Blog

This repo contains the code for my personal blog focused on different technologies I encounter as a developer. The goal is to have a performant, blazing fast blog site that's easy to write quick articles via markdown.

This site is a NextJS blog bootstrapped with the [Tailwind Blog Template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).

## Articles

Topics that interest me and that I'm likely to write about are computer science, machine learning, AI, web development, and software engineering in general.

## Tech Stack

- NextJS
- MDX (Markdown)
