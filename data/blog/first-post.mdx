# Introduction

Welcome to the first post. My goal here is to write and document things I find interesting while investigating web technologies and software.
I'm interested in all things programming, and think it could be valuable to share some things I find. Topics will include programming languages, packages, machine learning & AI, virtualization, whatever I may be working on.

Hopefully you're interested too. Thanks for reading.
